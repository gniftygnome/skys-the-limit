# Skys the Limit
The Gnomecraft sky block support mod.

Skys the Limit requires [Cloth Config](https://github.com/shedaniel/cloth-config)!

## Features of the Skys the Limit mod

This mod provides support for the Gnomecraft sky block ecosystem; namely:

* Adding glue recipes and loot for mods in Gnomecraft sky block mod packs.
  * Adds This Rocks! stone splitters as junk loot to fishing.
  * Recipe for crafting This Rocks! stone splitters into Craftable Lava stone buckets.
  * Recipe for crafting mixed This Rocks! stone splitters into cobblestone. 
  * Recipe for crafting Farmer's Delight tree bark into string.
  * Recipe for crafting string into Farmer's Delight rope.
* Adding recipes and loot for vanilla Minecraft features to improve sky block play.
  * Adds more ocean-related treasure loot to fishing.
  * Recipe for crafting dirt and wheat seeds into grass blocks.
  * Recipe for crafting leather, string, and iron into saddles.  (But why?  Nobody knows...)
* In select cases when no existing mod seems to work, adding entire new sky block game features.
  * Fog Catcher, an added block used to capture water from the fog that exists everywhere in Minecraft.
* Providing in-game documentation of Gnomecraft sky block play.
  * (not yet implemented)

## What can you do with this mod?

Whatever you want.  The main purpose of Skys the Limit is to be used in my sky block mod pack but feel free to
use it in yours or steal code from it or whatever.  I will also consider feature requests and implement them if
I like them.  Although this mod is extensively configurable, all features are enabled by default because they
would not be in the mod if I didn't want to use them.
