## What can you do with this mod?

Whatever you want.  The main purpose of Sky's the Limit is to be used in my sky block mod pack but feel free to
use it in yours or steal code from it or whatever.  I will also consider feature requests and implement them if
I like them.  Although this mod is extensively configurable, all features are enabled by default because they
would not be in the mod if I didn't want to use them.
